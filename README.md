[![Build Status](https://github.com/emirror-de/axum-gate/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/emirror-de/axum-gate/actions)

Flexible, type-safe authentication and authorization for Axum using JWTs and optional OAuth2.
- Cookie and bearer authentication
- OAuth2 Authorization Code + PKCE flow that issues first-party JWT cookies
- Hierarchical roles, groups, and string-based permissions
- Ready-to-use login/logout handlers
- Optional anonymous user context and static-token mode for internal services
- In-memory and optional database-backed repositories
- Feature-gated audit logging and Prometheus metrics

## Install

This crate re-exports jsonwebtoken, cookie, uuid, axum_extra (and optionally prometheus) because those types appear in the public API, and it provides a convenience prelude via axum_gate::prelude::*.


```toml
[dependencies]
axum = "0.8"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
serde = { version = "1", features = ["derive"] }
axum-gate = { version = "1" }
```

Optional features:
- storage-surrealdb — SurrealDB repositories
- storage-seaorm — SeaORM repositories
- audit-logging — structured audit events
- prometheus — metrics for audit (implies audit-logging)
- insecure-fast-hash — faster Argon2 preset for development only
- aws_lc_rs — Use AWS Libcrypto for JWT cryptographic operations

## Core concepts

- Gate layer
  - Gate::cookie("issuer", codec): JWT via HTTP-only cookies (web apps)
  - Gate::bearer("issuer", codec): JWT via Authorization: Bearer header (APIs)
  - Gate::bearer(...).with_static_token("..."): shared-secret mode (internal services)
  - Gate::oauth2::<R, G>(): OAuth2 Authorization Code + PKCE flow builder; or use Gate::oauth2_with_jwt("issuer", codec, ttl_secs) to also mint first-party JWT cookies
  - allow_anonymous_with_optional_user(): never block; inserts optional user context
  - require_login(): allow baseline role and all supervisors (hierarchy)
- Access policies
  - require_role(..), require_role_or_supervisor(..)
  - require_group(..)
  - require_permission("domain:action") — deterministic hashing to PermissionId; use validate_permissions! to catch collisions at test-time
- Login/logout
  - route_handlers::login: verifies credentials and sets the auth cookie
  - route_handlers::logout: removes the auth cookie
- Repositories
  - repositories::memory::{MemoryAccountRepository, MemorySecretRepository}
  - Optional SurrealDB / SeaORM backends via feature flags
- JWT codec
  - codecs::jwt::JsonWebToken with JsonWebTokenOptions (use persistent keys in production)

## Cryptographic Backend Selection

This crate supports two cryptographic backends for JWT operations:

| Backend | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `rust_crypto` | ✅ | Pure Rust implementation, works on all platforms without system dependencies |
| `aws_lc_rs` | ❌ | AWS Libcrypto implementation, potentially faster on some platforms |

### Using the Default Backend (rust_crypto)

The crate uses `rust_crypto` by default, which requires no additional setup:

```toml
[dependencies]
axum-gate = "1" # Uses rust_crypto by default
```

### Switching to AWS Libcrypto (aws_lc_rs)

To use the AWS Libcrypto backend for potentially better performance:

```toml
[dependencies]
axum-gate = { version = "1", default-features = false, features = ["aws_lc_rs"] }
```

Note: The `aws_lc_rs` backend may require additional build tools depending on your platform.
See the [aws-lc-rs build documentation](https://github.com/aws/aws-lc-rs/blob/main/aws-lc-rs/README.md#build) for details.


## Security

- Use a persistent JWT key (do not rely on the default random key in production)
- Keep the issuer consistent between Gate configuration and RegisteredClaims
- Use secure cookie settings in production (HttpOnly, Secure, appropriate SameSite)
- Rate-limit sensitive endpoints (e.g., login)
- Enable `audit-logging` and `prometheus` features for observability; never log secrets, tokens, or cookie values

## Examples and docs

Examples and complete usage are available in the crate documentation on docs.rs; the repository also includes curated examples (e.g., examples/oauth2-github for a full GitHub OAuth2 flow):
