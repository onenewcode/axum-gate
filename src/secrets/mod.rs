/// A cryptographically secure secret (password) bound to a specific user account.
///
/// This type represents a hashed password or other sensitive authentication data that is
/// cryptographically bound to a specific account through its unique identifier. The secret
/// is automatically hashed using the Argon2 algorithm when created, ensuring that plaintext
/// passwords are never stored in memory or persistent storage.
///
/// # Security Properties
///
/// - **Irreversible hashing**: Plaintext secrets cannot be recovered from the hash
/// - **Unique salting**: Each secret has a cryptographically random salt
/// - **Timing attack resistance**: Verification operations run in constant time
/// - **Account binding**: Secrets are tied to specific account IDs for additional security
///
/// # Usage in Authentication Flows
///
/// Secrets are typically created during user registration and verified during login:
///
/// ```rust
/// use axum_gate::secrets::Secret; use axum_gate::hashing::argon2::Argon2Hasher; use axum_gate::verification_result::VerificationResult;
/// use axum_gate::accounts::AccountInsertService;
/// use uuid::Uuid;
///
/// # tokio_test::block_on(async {
/// // During registration
/// let account_id = Uuid::now_v7();
/// let user_password = "user_entered_password";
/// let hasher = Argon2Hasher::new_recommended().unwrap();
///
/// let secret = Secret::new(&account_id, user_password, hasher.clone())?;
///
/// // During login verification
/// let login_attempt = "user_entered_password";
/// match secret.verify(login_attempt, hasher)? {
///     VerificationResult::Ok => {
///         // Grant access - password is correct
///         println!("Authentication successful");
///     },
///     VerificationResult::Unauthorized => {
///         // Deny access - password is incorrect
///         println!("Authentication failed");
///     }
/// }
/// # Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
/// # });
/// ```
///
/// # Storage Considerations
///
/// Secrets should be stored separately from account data for enhanced security:
///
/// - Use dedicated secret repositories ([`SecretRepository`])
/// - Consider separate databases for account metadata vs. authentication secrets
/// - Implement appropriate access controls on secret storage
/// - Regular backup and recovery procedures for authentication data
///
/// # Performance Notes
///
/// Secret hashing and verification are intentionally computationally expensive operations
/// (typically 100-500ms) to resist brute-force attacks. Consider:
///
/// - Implementing rate limiting on authentication endpoints
/// - Using async/await to prevent blocking during verification
/// - Caching verification results appropriately (with security considerations)
///
/// The `account_id` must correspond to a valid account in an
/// [`AccountRepository`](crate::accounts::AccountRepository) to create a correct secret.

    /// Creates a new secret by hashing the provided plaintext password.

    /// This method takes a plaintext secret (typically a user password) and creates a new

    /// hashing service. The original plaintext is never stored.

    ///
    /// - `account_id`: The unique identifier of the account this secret belongs to
    /// - `plain_secret`: The plaintext password or secret to be hashed
    /// - `hasher`: The hashing service implementation (typically [`Argon2Hasher`](crate::hashing::argon2::Argon2Hasher))
    ///
    /// # Security
    ///
    /// - The plaintext secret is immediately hashed and the original value is dropped
    /// - A cryptographically secure random salt is generated for each secret
    /// - The resulting hash is computationally infeasible to reverse
    ///
    /// # Errors
    ///

    /// - The hash was created using a secure, compatible algorithm (preferably Argon2)

    /// Verifies a plaintext secret against the stored hash.

    /// This method performs constant-time verification of a plaintext secret (typically
    /// a password entered by a user) against the stored cryptographic hash. The verification
    /// process is designed to be resistant to timing attacks.
    ///
    /// # Parameters
    ///
    /// - `plain_secret`: The plaintext secret to verify (e.g., user-entered password)
    /// - `hasher`: The hashing service to use for verification (must be compatible with the stored hash)
    ///
    /// # Returns
    ///
    /// - [`VerificationResult::Ok`] if the plaintext secret matches the stored hash
    /// - [`VerificationResult::Unauthorized`] if the secrets don't match or verification fails
    ///
    /// # Security Properties
    ///
    /// - **Constant-time operation**: Verification takes the same time regardless of correctness
    /// - **No information leakage**: Incorrect attempts don't reveal information about the stored secret
    /// - **Timing attack resistance**: Prevents attackers from using timing differences to guess secrets
    ///
    /// # Performance
    ///
    /// Secret verification is computationally intensive by design (typically 100-500ms)
    /// to make brute-force attacks impractical. This is normal and expected behavior
    /// for secure password hashing algorithms like Argon2.

    /// - Incompatible hashing algorithms between creation and verification
