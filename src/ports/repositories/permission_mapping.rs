/// Repository abstraction for persisting and retrieving [`PermissionMapping`] entities.
///
/// This trait enables the optional registry pattern for permission string mappings,
/// allowing reverse lookup from permission IDs back to their normalized string
/// representations. This is implemented alongside the existing bitmap-based
/// permission system without replacing it.
///
/// # Purpose
///
/// The permission mapping repository provides optional functionality for:
/// - Debugging and logging with human-readable permission names
/// - Administrative interfaces showing permission details
/// - Audit trails with readable permission descriptions
/// - Permission reporting and analysis
///
/// # Usage Pattern
///
/// This repository is intended to be used optionally alongside the existing
/// `Permissions` struct. When permission strings need to be recoverable:
///
/// ```rust
/// # use axum_gate::auth::{PermissionMapping, Permissions};
/// # use axum_gate::advanced::PermissionMappingRepository;
/// # use axum_gate::storage::MemoryPermissionMappingRepository;
///
/// // In-memory repository
/// let repo = MemoryPermissionMappingRepository::default();
///
/// // Store the mapping when granting permissions
/// let mapping = PermissionMapping::from("read:api");
/// let mut permissions = Permissions::new();
/// permissions.grant(mapping.normalized_string());
///
/// // Persist mapping for reverse lookup
/// let stored = tokio_test::block_on(repo.store_mapping(mapping.clone())).unwrap();
/// assert!(stored.is_some());
///
/// // Later, retrieve the normalized string via PermissionId
/// let fetched = tokio_test::block_on(repo.query_mapping_by_id(mapping.permission_id())).unwrap();
/// assert!(matches!(fetched, Some(m) if m.normalized_string() == "read:api"));
/// ```
///
/// # Consistency Guarantees
///
/// Implementations SHOULD:
/// - Enforce uniqueness of both permission IDs and normalized strings
/// - Validate mapping consistency before storage (use `PermissionMapping::validate()`)
/// - Handle concurrent access safely
/// - Provide atomic operations where possible
///
/// # Performance Considerations
///
/// Since this is an optional feature for human-readable lookups:
/// - Implementations may prioritize consistency over performance
/// - Caching strategies are encouraged for frequently accessed mappings
/// - Bulk operations are not required but may be added via extension traits
///
/// # Error Handling
///
/// Return `Err` for exceptional backend failures (connectivity, serialization,
/// constraint violations). Use `Ok(None)` for "not found" / "no-op" outcomes.
/// Validation errors should be caught early using `PermissionMapping::validate()`.
///
/// # Example Implementation Patterns
///
/// ```rust
/// use axum_gate::auth::{Permissions, PermissionMapping};
/// use axum_gate::advanced::PermissionMappingRepository;
/// use axum_gate::storage::MemoryPermissionMappingRepository;
///
/// async fn grant_permission_with_registry(
///     permissions: &mut Permissions,
///     registry: &MemoryPermissionMappingRepository,
///     permission_str: &str,
/// ) -> axum_gate::errors::Result<()> {
///     let mapping = PermissionMapping::from(permission_str);
///     // Grant the permission (primary operation)
///     permissions.grant(mapping.normalized_string());
///     // Store the mapping for reverse lookup (optional), but don't fail if it errors
///     registry.store_mapping(mapping).await?;
///     Ok(())
/// }
///
/// // Usage
/// # #[tokio::test]
/// # async fn usage() {
/// let repo = MemoryPermissionMappingRepository::default();
/// let mut permissions = Permissions::new();
/// grant_permission_with_registry(&mut permissions, &repo, "read:api").await.unwrap();
/// assert!(permissions.has("read:api"));
/// # }
/// ```
